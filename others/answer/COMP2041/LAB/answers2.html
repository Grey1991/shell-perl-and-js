<h3>Submission Summary</h3>
Due

Sunday midnight


<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">give cs2041 lab02 &lt;programs&gt;</kbd>
</pre>




<h3>Objectives</h3>


Understanding regular expressions and their use with Unix filters.





<h3>Getting Started</h3>


Create a new directory for this lab called <code>lab02</code> by typing:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">mkdir lab02</kbd>
</pre>

Change to this directory by typing:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">cd lab02</kbd>
</pre>




<h3>Preparation</h3>



The file <a href="lab02.txt">lab02.txt</a> contains a template which you must use
to enter the answers for this weeks lab.  You can copy &amp; edit the file like this:
<p>

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">cp /web/cs2041/17s2/tlb/02/lab02.txt .</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">gedit lab02.txt &</kbd>
</pre>

The autotest scripts depend on the format of this file so just add your answers
don't otherwise change the file.

<h3>Analyzing a Dictionary with egrep &amp; Regular Expressions</h3>

On most Unix systems you will find one or more dictionaries containing many thousands of
words usually in the directories.<code>/usr/share/dict/</code> or <code>/usr/dict/</code>.
<p>
We copied one such dictionary named <a href="words.txt">words.txt</a> for this lab exercise.
To save repeatedly typing its full pathname for these exercises,
make a symbolic link to the file with this command:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">ln -s /web/cs2041/17s2/tlb/02/words.txt</kbd>
</pre>

This creates a link to the file in the current directory pointing to
the original file, without taking up the space of a complete copy.
<p>

<ol>
<li>

Write an egrep command  that prints  the words in <a href="words.txt">words.txt</a>
which contain in characters "lmn" consecutively.
<p>
<b>Hint</b>:  it should print:


    
        
    






<pre class="command_line" style="max-height: 32em;overflow:  auto;">

</pre>
<p>
<div class="answer">
Sample answer:
<pre>egrep 'lmn' words.txt</pre>
</div>

The COMP2041 class account contains a script named <b>autotest</b>
that automatically runs 1 or more tests on your lab exercises.
<p>
If you have entered you answer for q1 you can check it like this:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">~cs2041/bin/autotest lab02 q1</kbd>
Test q1 (grep '^Q1 answer' lab02.txt|tail -1|sed 's/.*answer[: ]*//'|sh) - passed
1 tests passed 0 tests failed
</pre>

Passing the autotest doesn't guarantee your answer is correct, of course, but
it may find a mistake you've missed so run autotest for each of the following questions
when you've enetered the answer in <code>lab02.txt</code>.

<li>

Write a shell pipeline  that prints the words that contain "zz", but do not end in apostrophe-s ('s)?
<p>
<b>Hint</b>:  it should print:

<h3>Challenge: Interesting Regexps</h3>
Use <code>egrep</code> to test your answers to these questions.
<p>
Try to solve these questions using the standard regular expression language described
in lectures.
<p>

<li>
Write a egrep command  that prints the lines in a file named <code>input.txt</code> containing
containing at least one <code>A</code> and at least one <code>B</code>.
For example:
<p>
<table border='1'>
<tr><th width='50%'>Matching<th width='50%'>Not Matching
<tr><td>Andrew's favourite Band is not<td>George is Brillant
<tr><td>ABBA<td>Andrew
<tr><td>BA<td>B
<tr><td>AB<td>A
</table>
<p>
So to test with egrep you might do this:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">cat >input.txt &lt;&lt;eof</kbd>
Andrew's favourite Band is not
George is Brillant
ABBA
Andrew
AB
BA
A
B
eof
<kbd class="shell">egrep 'REGEXP' input.txt</kbd>
Andrew's favourite Band is not
ABBA
AB
BA
</pre>

<div class="answer">
<pre>egrep 'A.*B|B.*A' input.txt</pre>
</div>

<li>
Write a egrep command  that prints the lines in a file named <code>input.txt</code> containing
only the characters <code>A</code> and  <code>B</code> such that
all pairs of adjacent A's occur before any pairs of adjacent B's.
In other words if there is pair of B's on the line , there can not be
a pair of A's afterwards.
<p>
<table border='1'>
<tr><th width='50%'>Matching<th width='50%'>Not Matching
<tr><td>ABAABAABAABBBBABB<td>BBAA
<tr><td>ABBA<td>ABBAA
<tr><td>ABAAAAAAAAAABBA<td>ABBABABABABAA
<tr><td>ABABABABA<td>ABBBAAA
<tr><td>A<td>BBABABABABABABAA
</table>
<p>
<div class="answer">
<pre>egrep '^(BA|A)*(|B)(AB|B)*(|A)$' input.txt</pre>
<p>
or courtesy Squish:
<p>
<pre>egrep '^(BA|A)*(BA|B)*$' input.txt</pre>
</div>
<li>
Write a egrep command  that prints the lines in a file named <code>input.txt</code> containing
only the characters <code>A</code> and  <code>B</code> such that
the number of A's is divisible by 4.
<p>
<table border='1'>
<tr><th width='50%'>Matching<th width='50%'>Not Matching
<tr><td>AAAA<td>AAAAA
<tr><td>BABABABAB<td>ABABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBAAA
<tr><td>AAAABBBBAAAA<td>AAAABBABBAAAA
<tr><td>BBBAABBBBBAABBBAAAA<td>BBBAABBABBBAABBBAAAA
</table>
<p>
<div class="answer">
<pre>egrep '^B*(AB*AB*AB*AB*)*$' input.txt</pre>
</div>

<li>
Write a egrep command  that prints the lines in a file named <code>input.txt</code> containing
only the characters <code>A</code> and  <code>B</code> such that
there are exactly <i>n</i> A's followed by
exactly <i>n</i> B's and no other characters.
<p>
<table border='1'>
<tr><th width='50%'>Matching<th width='50%'>Not Matching
<tr><td>AAABBB<td>AAABB
<tr><td>AB<td>BA
<tr><td>AABB<td>AABBB
<tr><td>AAAABBBB<td>AAAABBBBA
</table>

<div class="answer">
This can't be done with a (true) regular expression.
You prove this via the the wonderfully named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_lemma_for_regular_languages">pumping lemma</a>.
<p>
It is possible with extensions to regular expressions, e.g. as  provided in Perl.

<pre>grep -P '^(A(?1)?B)$' input.txt</pre>
</div>

<h3>Autotest All Questions</h3>

</pre>

The autotests for this week are very simple but they will pick up silly mistakes.





<h3>Submission</h3>

When you are finished submit your work by running:
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">give cs2041 lab02 &lt;programs&gt;</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
Don't submit any exercises you haven't attempted.

If you are working at home, you may find it more convenient
to upload your work via
 <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~give/code/login.php?app=/~give/Student/give.php&amp;debug=get_authuser">give's web interface</a>.
<p>
Remember you have until

Sunday midnight


to submit your work.




<h3>Assessment</h3>

This lab exercises is worth 1 mark.
<p>
Labs exercise are either automarked or peer assessed.
This is to allow tutors' time to be used to assist students.
<p>
After the automarking is complete you should be able to view it by running
this command on a CSE machine:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">2041 classrun -collect lab02
</pre>

You can inspect marks for this lab and other assessment components via <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~give/code/login.php?app=/~give/Student/give.php&amp;debug=get_authuser">give's web interface</a> or by running

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">2041 classrun -sturec
</pre>

<p>
Reminder: lab marks contribute 9% to your final COMP[29]041 final mark.
<p>
The 11 lab marks will be summed at the end of session and the sum capped at 9 marks.
<p>
Hence you can obtain full marks for the 9% lab component without obtaining full marks every week.
